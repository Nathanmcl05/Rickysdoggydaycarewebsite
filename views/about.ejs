    <h1>About Rick's Doggy Daycare</h1>
  </header>
 <h3>Our Journey</h3>
  <main>
    <p>Ricky’s Doggy Daycare was founded by Ricky, a lifelong dog lover who grew up with a Golden Labrador, Bailey, by his side, learning firsthand the loyalty, joy, and companionship that dogs bring into everyday life. He developed a strong passion for dog care and grooming from an early age.</p>

    <p>As he got older, Ricky began babysitting his friends', neighbours', and local families’ dogs while they were away. He gained hands-on experience looking after dogs of all breeds, learning the importance of safety, routine, and individual attention. What started as a simple favour quickly became something he genuinely loved. Spending time caring for different dogs, learning their personalities, and earning their trust made him realise that working with dogs wasn’t just a hobby, it was a passion.</p>

    <p>Ricky noticed a growing need in Cork for a safe, reliable, and caring dog daycare service. Seeing how much joy and fulfilment this brought him, Ricky decided to open a small doggy daycare from his own home...</p>

    <h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>At Ricky’s Doggy Daycare, our mission is to provide a safe, loving, and fun environment where every dog is treated like family. We are committed to offering high-quality care, personalised attention, and professional grooming services, ensuring dogs are happy, healthy, and excited to come back. Our goal is to give owners peace of mind, knowing their pets are in trusted hands.</p>
