  <h1>About Rick's Doggy Daycare</h1>
  <p>Ricky’s Doggy Daycare was founded by Ricky, a lifelong dog lover who grew up with a Golden Labrador, Bailey, by his side, learning firsthand the loyalty, joy, and companionship that dogs bring into everyday life. He developed a strong passion for dog care and grooming from an early age.</p>

<p>As he got older, Ricky began babysitting his friends', neighbours', and local families’ dogs while they were away. He gained hands-on experience looking after dogs of all breeds, learning the importance of safety, routine, and individual attention. What started as a simple favour quickly became something he genuinely loved. Spending time caring for different dogs, learning their personalities, and earning their trust made him realise that working with dogs wasn’t just a hobby, it was a passion.</p>

<p>Ricky noticed a growing need in Cork for a safe, reliable, and caring dog daycare service. Seeing how much joy and fulfilment this brought him, Ricky decided to open a small doggy daycare from his own home...</p>

<h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>
